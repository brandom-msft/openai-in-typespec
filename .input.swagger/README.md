# Service version support history

This file is a reference of the versions of the services supported by the TypeSpec definitions found in this repository.

Each version which is supported should be add as a subsection using ### and also please provide a highlevel changelog of the new changes introduced from the previously supported version, where possible.

- For OpenAI, please use the commit hash (also update the submodule with the actual definition found in `./openai-openapi`). 
- For Azure OpenAI, please use the name of the version as you would write it in the `ServiceApiVersion` enum (once this is introduced)

## OpenAI

- Nothing to add, as this is the starting point for version support (went digging around for the commit hash that corresponded to the service swagger definition that matched the content of what was checked in the parent repo)

## Azure OpenAI

**TODO: would be cool to simply paste the wiki link here, but not sure if we can do so publicly. Otherwise, simply paste the full article? There are documentation falling out of sync considerations with that approach.**
